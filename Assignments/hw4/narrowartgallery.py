"""
Setup:

Gallery has N rows Ã— 2 columns = 2N rooms total
Each room has a value
Must close exactly k rooms
Visitors enter from one end, exit from the other end

Constraints (can't close these combinations):

Two rooms in the same row (blocks horizontal passage)
Two diagonally adjacent rooms (blocks diagonal passage)

Goal:
Close k rooms to maximize the total value of remaining open rooms.
Input:

Line 1: N (rows), k (rooms to close)
Next N lines: two integers (values of left and right room in that row)
End: "0 0"

Output:
Maximum total value of open rooms after closing k rooms optimally.
Key Insight
This is the opposite of a typical optimization: instead of "select k items to maximize value," you're "exclude k items to maximize remaining value."
Total value available - Value of closed rooms = Value of open rooms
So maximize: sum(all rooms) - sum(k closed rooms)
Which means: minimize the value of k closed rooms you select
Constraints translate to:

Can't close both rooms in same row
Can't close diagonally adjacent rooms (room[i][0] and room[i+1][1], or room[i][1] and room[i-1][0])

This is a 2D DP problem similar to knapsack but with adjacency constraints.
